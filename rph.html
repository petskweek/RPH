        <p class="lead text-center"><b>History of Cordova</b></p>
        <p>Cordova was once part of Opon, now called Lapu-Lapu City, and it was called Day-as. Its first attempt to secede from Opon was in 1863. The inhabitants found it difficult to discharge their duties and obligations to the church and municipality because of the distance, coupled with a lack of roads</p>
        <p>Padre Simon Aguirre, the parish priest of Opon at that time, encouraged the residents of Day-as to send a resolution for the establishment of a municipality. The resolution was granted and the new town was named Cordova after a city in Spain. Day-as remained a barangay and its name was derived from the Cebuano word "day-lang" which means "abundance of fish".</p>
